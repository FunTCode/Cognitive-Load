## Project Description

This project is a collection of data and program code for two experiments. The experiments are designed to study the effects of different factors on the performance of a specific task. The data and program code are provided to help researchers replicate and extend the experiments.

## Directory Structure

This project consists of two folders, each containing data and program code for a specific experiment.

├─ exp_1 \# Data and program code for Experiment 1

├─ exp_2 \# Data and program code for Experiment 2

├─ Font \# Font files (if any)

└─ Kit \# Toolkits or other auxiliary files

## Data File Description

Due to the need for privacy protection of subjects, the data files have been noise-cleaned. Therefore, running the experimental code may result in slightly different outcomes, but this does not affect the final conclusion of the experiments.

## Usage Instructions

1.  Download or clone this project to your local computer.
2.  Prepare the runtime environment and make sure the required dependencies are installed. You can install the dependencies using the following command：
        ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
3.  Open the exp_1 or exp_2 folder to view the corresponding data and program code.
4.  Run the code as needed and analyze the results accordingly.
